<h1>Functionality A/B test</h1>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>This A/B test has been set up to provide research on the functionality of the current build after the recommendations on the 
DWP report in December.</p>

<p>The test will compare the GDS/DWP task list approach including breakdown forms into further steps against the current functionality. 
The basic structure of (A) will mimac the full user journey of the current build which we will test against an alternative (B) version 
using the GDS task list approach. Both probes have been built to push the test subject/user through both journeys 
in a certain direction, only filling in specific areas.</p>
