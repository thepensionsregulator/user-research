<h1>Navigation A/B test - Current build vs GDS task list</h1>

<p>This A/B test has been set up to provide research on the functionality of the current build after the recommendations on the first two 
reports from the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) with their feedback based on the Government Design Standard (GDS).</p>

<blockquote>Quote from section of the report where DWP speak about the task list and also moving towards question by question</blockquote>

<p>The test will compare the GDS task list approach against the current functionality. The basic structure of test (A) will mimac but not completely 
run through the full user journey of the current build which we will test against the alternative test (B) using the GDS task list approach on DWPs 
recommendation. Both probes have been built to push the user through both journeys in the same specific direction. The user will only fill in the 
areas of the return indicated and will have instructions as they move through the prototypes when it divates from the usual user journey.</p>
